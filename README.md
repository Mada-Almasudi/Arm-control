# Arm-control
I created a [user interface](https://mada-almasudi.github.io/Arm-control/) in (html and css languages) that contains 6 slides for motors,each motor moves at a maximum angle of 180.
I  also ceated a run button and save button to save the data entered in the database
 and a database that contains one table called "motor" with 8 columns inside 6 of them are for the motors ,2 of them are for run and save buttons+chatbot
